Write a program that counts the frequencies of each word in a text, and
output each word with its count and line numbers where it appears. We
define a word as a contiguous sequence of non-white-space characters.
Different capitalizations of the same character sequence should be
considered same word (e.g. Python and python). The output is formatted as
follows: each line begins with a number indicating the frequency of the word,
a white space, then the word itself, and a list of line numbers containing this
word. You should output from the most frequent word to the least frequent.
In case two words have the same frequency, the lexicographically smaller
one comes first. All words are in lower case in the output.
